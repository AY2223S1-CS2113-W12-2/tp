## Introduction

Financial bookkeeping via traditional mobile applications has always been a hassle due to the repetitive clicks needed to
manage monetary transactions. With Moolah Manager, you will be encouraged to take ownership of managing your finances via
a time-saving and efficient command-line (CLI) interface.

The main features of Moolah Manager include:

- Managing records of monetary transactions
- Gathering financial insights such as categorical savings and periodic expenditure
- General budgeting and reminders about spending

The application is optimised for use with a keyboard and all you need is to just type in your commands into a terminal.
Moreover, if you are a fast-typist, the recording and querying of transactions can be performed efficiently.

## About This Guide

### What is in Moolah Manager
Moolah Manager is a comprehensive app for Financial bookkeeping using an intuitive CLI platform, with many features
you can use!

In our managing records features, you can add, delete, edit monetary transaction entries to keep their records 
up-to-date. Moolah Manager also features the ability to edit dates of transactions and add categories to better 
classify the expenses.

As for statistics, Moolah Manager supports the viewing of summarised expenses in daily, weekly and monthly formats. 
This enables you to better understand your expenses, and savings across various time periods. In addition, Moolah 
Manager also shows which category of expenses users spend more on so that they can better manage spending. 

Beyond just tracking expenses, Moolah Manager allows you to set your expense budgets to take charge of your spending 
habits. You will be able to allocate budgets for different categories or for the week to better stick to your plans. 

Lastly, our additional features will ensure that you will be able to seek help with the commands with a list of usable 
commands and guides for using the application for first time users. Moolah Manager will also save the application 
expenses everytime it is updated, so that you donâ€™t have to!

### Command Format

General illustrations about the text format used for the commands in this guide can be found below. 

1. The **first word** in the command refers to the command word to be supplied by the user. The command words are case-insensitive. 
   1. e.g. `bye`, `BYE` and `bYe` will all be interpreted as the same.

2. Words in `UPPER CASE` refer to the parameters in each command. Each parameter must be prepended with a tag.
   1. e.g. in `delete e/ENTRY`, `delete` is the command word, while `ENTRY` is a parameter expected after the tag `e/`.

3. Parameters in square brackets are optional.
   1. e.g. `help [o/detailed]` can be used as `help o/detailed` or `help.
   2. Note that the parameter `detailed` is written in lower case here, which means, only the exact wording is accepted.

4. Each parameter is separated by a space. Users are not allowed to use spaces in their parameter, *except for `find` command*.

## Others

### Persistent Data

Our program comes with a storage feature to ensure user data gets saved each time Moolah Manager is stopped and restarted.
If you are accessing Moolah Manager via our JAR file release, the storage file, **duke.txt** would be newly created in a newly created **data** folder in your current directory.

In duke.txt, the monthly budget value would be stored on the 1st line, with the different transaction entries on subsequent lines.
We **DO NOT** recommend editing duke.txt unless you are familiar with the storage syntax of the program.

### Exiting the Program: `bye`

Exits the program.

Format: `bye`

Example(s):

`bye`

Expected output:
```
bye
____________________________________________________________
Goodbye and see you soon.
____________________________________________________________

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I view commands while the app is running? 
* **A**: Type `help` command to view all the commands!

**Q**: Can I directly input values into the duke.txt file? 
* **A**: It is strongly advisable not to edit the duke.txt file as that could disrupt Moolah Manager's retrieval of the data.

**Q**: What should I do if most of my transactions are incorrect?
* **A**: You can consider using the edit or delete function to modify individual transactions at a time. However, if
 there are too many transactions to change, you can consider using the purge function to delete all values. 
 
**Q**: What is the purpose of using the different statistics commands?
* **A**: They provide you with great flexibility in viewing the current transactions from different perspectives. To analyze 
all of the stored transactions, use `stats s/categorical_savings` or `stats s/monthly_expenditure`. Otherwise, use stats s/time_insights
to analyze transactions for a specified time period.
